# Corporalabs

# Project info

- Xcode 12.4
- Swift 5.3

# Architecture: MVVM

It is the most widespread architecture recommended by apple and adapts to the characteristics of the project.

For this reason, I think it is a good option for the development of this project.


# External libs

# Unit Testing

Unit testing allows us to isolate those parts of the code that we are interested in to ensure its correct functioning.
I have included tests of what is most susceptible to failure
